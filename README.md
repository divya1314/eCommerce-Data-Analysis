## 🎯 Tasks and Deliverables  

### 1. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights  
- **Goal**: Uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights from the dataset.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with EDA code.  
  - `EDA_Report.pdf`: PDF report with 5+ business insights and visualizations.  

### 2. 🔍 Lookalike Model  
- **Goal**: Build a model to recommend 3 similar customers based on profile and transaction history.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - `Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with model development code.  
  - `Lookalike.csv`: CSV file with top 3 lookalikes for the first 20 customers.  

### 3. 🎯 Customer Segmentation using Clustering  
- **Goal**: Group customers into meaningful segments using clustering techniques.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - `Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with clustering code.  
  - `Clustering_Report.pdf`: PDF report with clustering results, metrics, and visualizations.

## 🌟 Key Insights and Results  

### 📊 EDA and Business Insights  
1. **Customer Distribution by Region**: South America and Europe dominate customer base.  
2. **Customer Signups Over the Years**: A massive spike in signups in 2024!  
3. **Product Category Distribution**: Electronics rule the product portfolio.  
4. **Price Distribution of Products**: Most products are priced between $50 and $200.  
5. **Transaction Analysis**: Single-quantity purchases dominate transactions.  

### 🔍 Lookalike Model  
- Recommends 3 similar customers for each of the first 20 customers, complete with similarity scores.  

### 🎯 Customer Segmentation  
- **Number of Clusters**: 4  
- **DB Index**: 1.34  
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.65  
- **Cluster Interpretation**:  
  - **High Spenders**: Big spenders, frequent buyers.  
  - **Frequent Buyers**: Moderate spenders, loyal customers.  
  - **Low-Engagement Customers**: Need re-engagement strategies.  
  - **High-Value Customers**: Fewer transactions, but high spending.
