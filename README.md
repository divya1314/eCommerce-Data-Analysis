# 🚀 eCommerce Customer Analytics: Segmentation and Insights  

Welcome to the **eCommerce Customer Analytics** project! This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior, building predictive models, and segmenting customers to derive actionable insights for an eCommerce business. Using transaction and customer data, we explore patterns, build a lookalike model, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## 🌟 Key Insights and Results  

### 📊 EDA and Business Insights  
1. **Customer Distribution by Region**: South America and Europe dominate customer base.  
2. **Customer Signups Over the Years**: A massive spike in signups in 2024!  
3. **Product Category Distribution**: Electronics rule the product portfolio.  
4. **Price Distribution of Products**: Most products are priced between $50 and $200.  
5. **Transaction Analysis**: Single-quantity purchases dominate transactions.  

### 🔍 Lookalike Model  
- Recommends 3 similar customers for each of the first 20 customers, complete with similarity scores.  

### 🎯 Customer Segmentation  
- **Number of Clusters**: 4  
- **DB Index**: 1.34  
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.65  
- **Cluster Interpretation**:  
  - **High Spenders**: Big spenders, frequent buyers.  
  - **Frequent Buyers**: Moderate spenders, loyal customers.  
  - **Low-Engagement Customers**: Need re-engagement strategies.  
  - **High-Value Customers**: Fewer transactions, but high spending.
